# API Boilerplate

This is just a simple boilerplate for creating RESTful APIs based on Node.js, Express and TypeScript.

I have created this because I'm too lazy to always getting the same packages everytime I need to start a new RESTful API project. Nothing else.

## Installing

---

Let's get the party started.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/felipeornelis/api-boilerplate.git
$ cd api-boilerplate
$ pnpm install
```

A tip to save your time: you can clone this repository to a specific folder with a shorter name.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/felipeornelis/api-boilerplate.git api
$ cd api
$ pnpm install

```

Hooray! Instead of _api-boilerplate_, the repository folder will be just _api_ (much better).

## Running the application

---

If you're really ready to go after installing all the dependencies, then go ahead with:

```sh
$ pnpm dev
```
